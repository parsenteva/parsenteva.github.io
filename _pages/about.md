I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Jean Leray Mathematics Laboratory](https://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/fr) ([Nantes Université](https://www.univ-nantes.fr)). My research interests lie in the domain of mathematical modeling in the biomedical context. My current post-doc with [ENS de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr) in collaboration with [Bertrand Michel](http://bertrand.michel.perso.math.cnrs.fr) and [Franck Picard](https://franckpicard.github.io) focuses on kernel-based machine learning for single cell data.

I did my PhD at the [Burgundy Institute of Mathematics](https://math.u-bourgogne.fr) ([Université de Bourgogne](https://www.u-bourgogne.fr)). My PhD in collaboration with the [IRSN](https://www.irsn.fr) under the supervision of [Hervé Cardot](https://cardot.perso.math.cnrs.fr) and [Mohamed Amine Benadjaoud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-amine-benadjaoud-a9162743/) focuses on modeling of adverse effects induced by radiotherapy on healthy tissues. The goal was to approach the problem from a multiscale perspective, in particular by studying:
- the dynamic of the in vitro omic response of the HUVEC cells to irradiation through extracting key information using such tools as clustering and network inference,
- the adverse effects accessible through in vivo mice data.
