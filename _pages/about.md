I am a PhD candidate at the [Burgundy Institute of Mathematics](https://math.u-bourgogne.fr) ([Université de Bourgogne](https://www.u-bourgogne.fr) - Dijon, France). My research interests lie in the domain of mathematical modeling in the biomedical context. My PhD in collaboration with the [IRSN](https://www.irsn.fr) focuses on modeling of adverse effects induced by radiotherapy on healthy tissues. The goal is to approach the problem from a multiscale perspective, in particular by studying:
- the dynamic of the in vitro omic response of the HUVEC cells to irradiation through extracting key information using such tools as clustering and network inference,
- the adverse effects accessible through in vivo mice data.

The PhD is under the supervision of [Hervé Cardot](https://cardot.perso.math.cnrs.fr) and [Mohamed Amine Benadjaoud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-amine-benadjaoud-a9162743/).
